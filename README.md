  via a backend web api request with c#

  Second page needs house:
  This should display some category filtration and outcome options.

  - a hamburger menu that expands across the app, maybe  
    containing an about, social links, and a list of all the visited places \*note to create 5th wire frame for past history list page.
  - this will be a list of check boxes that will help
    filter out things that a user may definitely know they don't want on their outing. The both button functions should take the checkbox input (if any) and lead users to a results page.

**3**
This page should house some random options within each of the 3 categories: food, drink, & adventure for users to choose from. This page should also allow a button function that should randomize only one of the above categories at a time and display a different random option to choose from.The very bottom of this page of the app should display an "agenda export" of some sort, or maybe a share prompt.

**4**
This page should allow users a closer look at the clicked upon option, and provide further details on the venue. Ideally, this page will allow for a shorter rotation of options perhaps. As well as a place to link to directions, direct website to book a table or make reservations, online reviews, etc.
